 Phase 1 â€“ Reconnaissance and Target Analysis

Objective:

    The reconnaissance phase aimed to identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities in the target machine. This foundational step is crucial for building an effective exploitation strategy.

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Network Configuration:

    Both Metasploitable2 and Kali Linux were set to use "Host-Only Adapter" networking to ensure they could communicate in an isolated lab environment.

2. IP Discovery:

    On Metasploitable2, the IP address was identified using:

    ifconfig
     
    The IP found was 192.168.56.102

 3. Ping Sweep:

    A ping scan was performed using Nmap to confirm the target was alive:
    
    nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24

  4. Port and Service Scan:

      A full TCP port scan and version detection was executed:
      
      nmap -sS -sV -p- 192.168.56.102
      
      This revealed multiple open ports and services:
      
      FTP (Port 21)
      
      SSH (Port 22)
      
      Telnet (Port 23)
      
      HTTP (Port 80)
      
      Samba (Ports 139 & 445)
      
      MySQL (Port 3306)
      
  5. Service Enumeration:

      Version detection revealed vulnerable services like:
      
      vsFTPd 2.3.4 (backdoored)
      
      Samba smbd 3.x (vulnerable to usermap exploit)
      
      Telnet allowing default credentials

  6. Web Interface Check:

      The HTTP service was accessed from the browser using:
      
      http://192.168.56.102
      
      It revealed links to DVWA, Mutillidae, and possible CGI paths.

   7. Vulnerability Research:

      Identified services were matched with known CVEs for targeted exploitation.
