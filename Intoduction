critical vulnerabilities, and provide remediation recommendations.

Objectives:

      Conduct reconnaissance to identify active services and potential entry points
      
      Exploit discovered vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access
      
      Perform post-exploitation tasks to evaluate system impact
      
      Recommend mitigations to prevent real-world exploitation


Tools Used:

      Nmap
      
      Metasploit Framework
      
      Telnet
