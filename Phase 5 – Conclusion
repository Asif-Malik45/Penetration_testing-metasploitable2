Phase 5 â€“ Conclusion

    This penetration testing assessment of a Metasploitable2-based SME environment revealed critical vulnerabilities across multiple
services, including FTP, Telnet, and Samba. Several successful exploits were performed, leading to full shell access, password
hash extraction, and privilege escalation.

    The use of weak passwords, outdated software, and exposed services significantly increased the system's attack surface. Recommendations 
have been provided to mitigate these issues in line with OWASP, CIS, and NIST security best practices.

    Routine penetration testing, continuous patching, and strong authentication policies are essential to maintaining system integrity 
and protecting sensitive business operations.
